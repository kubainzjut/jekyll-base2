*this is in italic*  and _so is this_

**this is in bold**  and __so is this__

***this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___

* an asterisk starts an unordered list
* and this is another item in the list
+ or you can also use the + character
- or the - character

To start an ordered list, write this:

1. this starts a list *with* numbers
+  this will show as number "2"
*  this will show as number "3."
9. any number, +, -, or * will keep the list going.
    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list
        1. keep indenting for more sub lists
    * here i'm back to the second level
